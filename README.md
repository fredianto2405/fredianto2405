# Hi, I'm Freddy 👋

Software Engineer who builds **backend systems that actually survive production**.  
I care about **clean architecture, performance, and systems that don’t fall apart under load**.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- Design & build **RESTful APIs**
- Backend architecture with **clean separation of concerns**
- Database-heavy systems (query optimization, schema design, migrations)
- Auth, security, and integration with external services

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack
**Languages**
- Go
- Java (Spring Boot, Quarkus)
- SQL

**Backend**
- Gin, sqlx, pgx  
- Spring Boot, Quarkus  
- JWT, Basic Auth, REST Client

**Database**
- PostgreSQL  
- Oracle

**DevOps / Infra**
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Nginx (Reverse Proxy)  
- Linux VPS

---

## 🧩 Architecture & Principles
- Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Modular Monolith > Premature Microservices
- Explicit > Implicit
- Simple > Clever

---

## 📌 Current Focus
- High-concurrency backend services
- Query performance & data consistency
- Reducing accidental complexity in codebases
- Writing code that **other engineers can actually maintain**
